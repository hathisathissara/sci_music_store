## üåå About The Project

Project Nebula is a conceptual e-commerce store with a science-fiction theme. The goal was to build a functional and dynamic web application using a classic and reliable web stack: PHP for the backend logic, MySQL for the database, and Bootstrap for a responsive, mobile-first frontend.

The application uses PHP sessions for user authentication and shopping cart management, and follows a multi-page application (MPA) architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a local server environment that can run PHP and MySQL.
*   **XAMPP** (for Windows/macOS/Linux) or a similar stack like WAMP (Windows) or MAMP (macOS).
    *   Download and install from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Clone the project into your local server's web directory.
    *   For **XAMPP**, this is typically the `htdocs` folder (`C:\xampp\htdocs`).
    ```sh
    git clone [Link to your repository] C:/xampp/htdocs/[your-project-folder]
    ```

2.  **Start your server:**
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

3.  **Set up the database:**
    a. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
    b. Create a new database. Let's call it `sci_music_store`.
    c. Select the new database and go to the **Import** tab.
    d. Click "Choose File" and select the `.sql` file from this project (e.g., `database/sci_music_store.sql`).
    e. Click "Go" to import the tables and data.

4.  **Configure the database connection:**
    a. Find the database connection file in the project (e.g., `includes/config.php` or `db_connect.php`).
    b. Open the file and update the database credentials to match your local setup.
    ```php
    <?php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root'); // Default for XAMPP
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');     // Default for XAMPP
    define('DB_NAME', 'sci_music_store'); // The database name you created
    ?>
    ```

5.  **You're all set!**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/[your-project-folder]`.
